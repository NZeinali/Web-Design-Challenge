# Web Design Project - Web Visualisation Dashboard (Latitude)

## Task

HTML and CSS are employed to create a dashboard showing off the weather data analysis.

For this project, a visualisation dashboard website is created using visualisations that were created in the past project (API_Challenge). Specifically, [weather data](Resources/cities.csv) is used for plotting.

In building this dashboard, individual pages are created for each plot and a means to enable navigation between them. These pages will contain the visualisations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, is also provided and another page to view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements

For reference, see the ["Screenshots" section](#screenshots) below.

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualisations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualisation.
* Four [visualisation pages](#visualisation-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualisation itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualisations on the same page to easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualisations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualisations.
